# infix to Postfix
data structures, DUT CS Course Data Structures and Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project implements an algorithm to convert infix expressions to postfix expressions (Reverse Polish Notation) using a stack-based approach. It is designed to handle standard arithmetic operations and parentheses.

### Features
- Conversion of complex arithmetic expressions from infix to postfix format.
- Handling of basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Support for parentheses in expressions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment
4. Install the required dependencies

## Usage
Run the application: infix2Postfix.exe
You can input your infix expression when prompted, or modify the script to convert a predefined infix expression.

## Example
Input: A + B * C - ( D * E + F ) * G
Output: A B C * + D E * F + G * -
